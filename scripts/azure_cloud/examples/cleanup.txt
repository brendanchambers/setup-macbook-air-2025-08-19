After deleting a VM,
I thiink the cleanup steps are:
 
- Delete the disk (via portal: click on disk, unattach if needed, delete)
    (via cli: todo)

- Delete Network security group

- Delete the public ip address

- Delete the network interface

- Delete the virtual network if desired


OR, delete the entire resource group and create a enw one



# looks like we can achieve this by specifying delete behavior during vm creation
